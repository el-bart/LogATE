# TODO list for this subproject

* enable colored output
* make colors user defined
* use "printers" to make output look nicer and better ordered
* add filter-tree browser/editor window
* add filter-node preview window
* add verbose-log-view window, that shows all attributes of a log and allow to create filters based on a current field selection
* add filter-creation window (type + setup)
* add store/load of setup, so that filters do not need to be re-defined over and over again
* enable automatic screen resizing
* threshold filter node - if value is over/under threshold, then it hits it.
* binary split filter - true/false nodes are created automatically, on a fly.
