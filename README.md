# LogATE

Log Analysis Tool Enhanced for processing and visualizing structured logs.

## idea

the concept is very universal - pretty much anything can generate such logs,
though it is best to use a logger already generates structure logs.

structured logs in C++ can be generated with BUT::Log (https://github.com/el-bart/but) library.
