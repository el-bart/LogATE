# TODOs

## library part

* saving filter tree
* loading filter tree
* sorting?
* maybe adding a child to Explode maybe should mean adding to all subnodes? how to do this? factory?
* search inside a given node set via regex (string is already implemented)
* add support for arrays in all the places in the code
* think about nice syntax for Path support of arrays


## UI

* key shortcuts for tabs switching fast
* colored highlighting of searched elements
* runtime edition of silent tags
* runtime edition of priority tags
* export logs from a given filter to a file
* make deleting root node possible, if there is just one child - then it will pivot root element with its child (useful for dropping non-interesting logs)
* add help screen with key shortcuts
* embed version tag (if present) and commit hash into a binary, so that it can be displayed on request
* add binary split node UI frontend


## misc

* run profiler to see where the bottlenecks are
